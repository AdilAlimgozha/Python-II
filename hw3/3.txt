I used to do a typical five-day week, but rtx after I came out of my maternity leave, I fieajauieyk decided parametrization fadauieyo that bkb I wanted rfayoaeiuae to spend more time with my children before they start school. After negotiating with my boss, we decided to cut my working week down to a three-day work week. This of course meant a significant cut in my pay too, as I'm paid on a pro-rata basis. I've since noticed, though, that my workload hasn't decreased in the slightest! I'm now doing five days' worth of work in three days, but getting paid much less for it! I find myself having to take work home just so that I can meet the deadlines. It's wearing me out trying to juggle work with looking after my children and my family, but I donâ€™t dare to bring this up with my boss because I think he feels as if he's made a huge concession letting me come in only three days a week.
